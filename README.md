# Engineering Basics

In this workshop, you will setup several tools, programming languages, libraries that will help you get started. You will also practice tools and workflows needed to be productive in data analytics.

The primary goal of the workshop is for you have to have setup a set of relevant tools for software development and data analysis.

## Configuration Management

To help us get started, we will we install some tools that make it a little easier to configure systems.

The advantage of having these tools is that it makes it easier to install large bundles of software, often automatically. These allows others to easily build software without worrying about missing a dependency.
