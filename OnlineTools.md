# Task Management

### Github Issues

Issue trackers, such as Bugzilla, originated as a bug reporting tools. A project hosted on github comes with an issue tracker too. Any one can report an issue, add labels, and assign any team member(s) can be assigned to an issue.

Nowadays, developers also use issues as a lightweight task management tool. For this usecase, it best works for smaller projects.

### Trello

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a planning tool that is inspired from kanban and agile methods.

In kanban, you have a “visual” pipeline for transitioning ideas into a delivered product. In trello, you can move a card (often representing a task) between lists.

##### Boards, Lists, Cards

Trello allows you to create boards.  On those boards, you can create lists.  Lists can be used to hold cards.

Recommended Pipeline:

* High-level goals: What do you want to accomplish?
* This Week: What actions can you do to accomplish those goals.
* Doing: What are you doing *today*
* Waiting: What is blocked.
* Done: What have you completed.

It is recommended that you break tasks down into 2--4 hour chunks. 

##### Signs of a bad Trello board

* Empty
* Only high-level goals
* Too many things
* Items sticking around not making progress.

Instead of saying "Do analysis" => "Find R package for doing peak detection". This is more concrete and actionable.

## Practice: Brainstorm some tasks for your data challenge

* Add some issues to your data challenge repo.
* Create a personal trello board for this summer.
