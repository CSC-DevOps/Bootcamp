# Markdown

Is a plain text format that can be used to express stylized text rendered as html (or even pdf). It is commonly used in online tools such as Github to make it easier to write reports or documentation.

```
### Header (like \<h3\>Header\</h3\>)

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.  A hard break can be created by adding two spaces after a sentance.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace` (inline code). 

Itemized lists look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

> Block quotes are
> written like so.

Hrefs have an anchor in brackets [] and (link in parens): [Markdown format](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

Code (`inline code`):

    print “Code is just indented four spaces”;
```
